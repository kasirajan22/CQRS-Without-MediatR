// This file has been removed as the repositories implement their interfaces directly
// without using a base repository pattern. This approach provides more flexibility
// and avoids the complexity of generic base classes.

// If you need common repository functionality in the future, consider:
// 1. Creating extension methods for common operations
// 2. Using composition instead of inheritance
// 3. Implementing specific interfaces for each repository
